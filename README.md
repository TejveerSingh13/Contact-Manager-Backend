# Contact-Manager-Backend
This repository is a backend project using Node.js and Express. The project encompasses a series of fundamental concepts that are essential and valuable for a backend position.    
I am creating a new repository and initiating a project based on a YouTube video tutorial. I will document the project with notes in the README file to make it a useful resource.
